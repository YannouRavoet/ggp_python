This repository is used for my thesis (2020-2021) on using ProbLog for General Game Playing. 
It will have the following functionalities:

    1. A parsing tool to translate GDL files into ProbLog code
    2. A Game Kiosk that allows you to setup matches
       (Singleplayer: Human or PC, Multiplayer: Human/PC vs Human/Pc)
    3. Three player algorithms: Legal, Random and MCTS
